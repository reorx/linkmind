/**
 * @deprecated — All functionality has been moved to pipeline.ts.
 * This file is kept for reference only. Do not import from this module.

 * Previously contained:
 *   - getAbsurd() — Absurd instance management
 *   - registerTasks() — process-link + refresh-related task definitions
 *   - spawnProcessLink() / spawnRefreshRelated() — task spawners
 *   - startWorker() — worker lifecycle
 *
 * All of the above now live in pipeline.ts as the single source of truth.
